  ///////////////////////////////
  Programming languages divides into types Strongly typed and loosely(weekly) types
  -Strongly Typed Langugages : Demand the specification of types
  typesctipt is Strongly typed language and it specify the types of data 
  -Loosely typed lkanguages :Ldo not require type specification

  Static and Dynamic typing

  language that is strongly typed ca be eithe statically or dynamically typed
  TypesScript is a statically typed language this means types are checked at compile time
  JavaScript is dynamically typed language means typesas are checked at run time

  Pros Typescript 
  -catch erros in dev!
  -great for teams
  -self-docuemntating

  explicit saying let userName : string="Jo";
